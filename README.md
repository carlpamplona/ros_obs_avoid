Obstacle Detection Using RPLIDAR A1

This package creates a ROS2 node that publishes joy commands to a differential drive robot. 
The joy command is dependent on detections by RPLIDAR. 
Additionally, it integrates YOLOv4 Tiny object detection using a trained 
TACO Dataset to determine if a detected object is on the left, center, or right of the frame, sending the joy command accordingly."
